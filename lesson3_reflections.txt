When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

It allows you to have a protected copy of your work. And allows you to work cooperatively with others. Or at least share what you have done with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You will want to have control over when changes are made to your working repository. You don't want unplanned changes occurring in your repository when changes are made by others. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A fork allows you to make copy of github  repository and maintain some link with the original. And this will also give credit to the original. A clone from github or locally will make a clean copy of a repository with no additional links. A branch makes a copy at a specific  point in the code history. It will only maintain history by reference to the branch point. And it is may exist in either a local or remote repository. But it does occur with in a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

This allows you to view the changes and the associated history.
