What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It initializes all of the git files for the repository. So git will now know that this is a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to keep track of files which you plan on adding. And it allows you to do it without creating any history.
